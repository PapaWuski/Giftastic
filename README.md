# Giftastic

## Verison 1

Giftastic will allow the user to input a string as a topic that will search through the Giphy API and return the first 10 images.
Empty strings will not be added to the list.
Clicking on any image will start the .Gif as well as set the card to green to allow the user to know what gif is currently playing.

A warning message will display if there are no .Gifs returned by the Giphy API.
